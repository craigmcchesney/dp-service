1. The API definitions for the response objects returned by queryProviders() and queryProviderMetadata() (both defined in the dp-grpc repo whose working directory is ~/dp.fork/dp-java/dp-grpc) has changed to embed a ProviderMetadata object in the QueryProvidersResponse object returned by queryProviders(), and move ProviderMetadata to the outer scope instead of embedding it within QueryProviderMetadataResponse.  Please find and fix compile errors related to this change.  The handling for populating the ProviderMetadata embedded in the QueryProvidersResponse object will be added in a follow-on task.
2. Please fix compile problems in the test classes QueryTestBase and GrpcIntegrationQueryServiceWrapper, and run the QueryProvidersTest and QueryProviderMetadataTest to make sure they pass.
